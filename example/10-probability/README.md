## Gibbs Sampling Algorithm

* https://mdbookspace.com/view/ai/gibbs.md

```
$ node gibbs
P = [0.5,0.5]
P = [0.6,0.4]
P = [0.62,0.38]
P = [0.624,0.376]
P = [0.6248,0.3752]
5/8=0.625 3/8=0.375
```

## Metropolis-Hasting Algorithm

* https://mdbookspace.com/view/ai/metropolis.md

```
$ node .\metropolis.js
Q = [[0.5,0.5],[0.5,0.5]]
A = [[1,0.6],[1.6666666666666667,1]]
diff = 0.2
Q = [[0.7,0.3],[0.5,0.5]]
A = [[1,1],[1,1]]
diff = 0
```

## EM Algorithm

```
$ npm i j6

$ node em
